# Timer

Timer is a simple timer.

## Installation

You don't need anything except a web browser.

## Usage

1/ Choose the numbers of hours, minutes, and seconds in the menu.
2/ Choose the type of ring you want to ring when the timeout is finished.
3/ Click on "Start".

## Contributing
I'd like the timer to show the time remaining dynamically in the "00:00:00" div.
